# Web-Dev-Portfolio
Websites I designed and made at the University of Hartford for my web development class.
You can see a preview of them with the screenshots.

This was my first real introduction to web development and you can see how I gradually got better.


## First Web Project
- For this task we designed a website about ourselves.

## Group Project
- This was a group project and each member was given a certain part of the page to design. I was tasked with completing the form.

## Site for a business
- Studetns had to do a website for a business as if we had an actual client.

## Final Site (My best one ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¤)
- This was our final project website and I choose to do it about my fictional app development business.
