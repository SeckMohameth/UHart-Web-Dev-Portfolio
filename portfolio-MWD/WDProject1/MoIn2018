        <h2>2018 Is My Year</h2>
        
        <p>This year I'm taking the initiative to learn how to code. Now recently I made it my goal to learn Android app development, but then switched to iOS and now it's web development. Honestly, I just want to code and make dope stuff. So, I've decided to stick with frontend web development and then move on to iOS app in the summer.
        Coding at first was really intimidating and it looked like you hade to be a genius to program, but now I see all it takes is patience and determination. I did some HTML and CSS in high school, but it didn't seem interesting at all. I couldn't picture myself sitting at a computer all day typing away. It wasn't until I got my first introduction to programming my freshmen year of college. Programming a robot for my engineering class was the most fun I have ever had writing code. From then on I was exploring other languages and seeing what else you can do with code and developing apps was one of them. I have a lot of goals for 2018 and coding makes up 90 percent of it. Honestly, it's the first New Year's resolution I've stuck with this long. </p>

        <h2>I'm starting a start up (sort of)</h2>
        
        <p>So I came up with an idea for an app and it's almost done. It's a fun video sharing app where you can challenge your friends. Me and a few friends are looking to build a business around it, but I wanna validate the idea before doing that.</p>
        
              
        <p>There's actually not much to do for the summer other than code, code, and code. I'll be working, but most of that money is to fund my app idea.<br> Most importantly, I'll be saving up money for a car this summer. Gonna be moving around a lot now and I'm gonna need some wheels to accommodate my busy schedule in the summer</p>
