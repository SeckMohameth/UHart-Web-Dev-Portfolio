        <h2>I love to code</h2>
        
        <p>Long story short, I found a new interest in coding and now I'm looking to change my major to computer science. A lot of the stuff I've learned so far are self taught from YouTube tutorials and documents online. Web development seems a lot easier to learn than other languages I've tried learning, but I don't think HTML and CSS count as programming languages.</p>
