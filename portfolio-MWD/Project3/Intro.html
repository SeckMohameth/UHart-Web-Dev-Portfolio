    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We've been in business for 27 years now and our vision has always been to enhance the flavoring of buffalo sauce. We have a passion for what we do and our customers can see it the minute the taste our food. It all started when I was helping my mom prepare dinner and mistakenly added ingridients that would inspire me to pursue my true calling. After that many years have been spent in the kitchen to come up with new an creative ways to push the boundaries of buffalo sauce. If there's one thing you can count on, it's that its always been about the buffalo</p>
