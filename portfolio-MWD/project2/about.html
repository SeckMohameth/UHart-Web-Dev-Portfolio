    <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
    <p><strong>Motto:</strong>Plaster Fun Time is the plaster painting place where kids do it THEIR way!</p><br>
    
    <p>We are guided by a belief that creativity is important for all ages and that it should be exercised with freedom and diversity of approaches. We are positive and supportive of everything that kids create here, regardless of what it looks like or how “right” it is.
We strongly encourage parents to step back and just let their kids go for it! (and to give themselves the permission to do the same!)</p>
