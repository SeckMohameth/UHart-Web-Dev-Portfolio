    <p>Contrary to what many think, Plaster Fun Time is not some giant company or organization, but locally owned Family business in the Boston area. Our belief in being local and providing awesome customer service has kept us from Franchising the concept that you have come to love.
Whatâ€™s new is due to popular demand, we are now helping others who want to bring the Plaster Fun Time magic into their local communities while owning their own business. With NO Franchise fees, our Licensees run their own business while getting the knowledge, support and supplies required from Plaster Fun Time.
