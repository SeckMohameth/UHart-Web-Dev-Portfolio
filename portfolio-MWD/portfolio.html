      <p>This I can proudly say was my first real web page I created. I've done html and css in high school, but this was the first time I gained more knowledge on the topic. From the first day of class to the completion of this project, I was
        introduced to the basic scructures of what made up a website. </p>

        <p>Project two was where things got a little bit trickey. In this project my group and I had to redesign a website we found online. I was given the task redesigning the contact page. Forms is not something I feel completely comfortable with,
          but this project demonstrates my understanding of this html tag.</p>

          <p>I had more fun creating project three than I did with the last two. I thought more about the look of the website and how I wanted to structure it before even writing a single line of code. Design was my main focus for this project.
            During the time of this assignment the internet was my greatest resource. From w3schools to Stack Overflow, I relized that in web development your always learning something new.</p>

            <p>My final project was everything we learned this semester and more. The business site was like a muscele we were working out through out the entire class. Every time it was getting better and better and I could visualy see the progress
              I was making. It was here that I found other methods to better structure and design my website. This portfolio page is taken right from the Service page of this site. This is the best site under my portfolio. Even though it lacks
              responsivness.</p>
